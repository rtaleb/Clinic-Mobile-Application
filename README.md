# Clinic-Mobile-Application
We simulate a real-life clinic where users can view doctors' profiles and register as patients or doctors. Patients view their own list of doctors and consult doctors. Doctors can view their patients, order exams, see medical records, and prescribe treatments. Authenticated users can also track treatment history and enter medical exam results.
